# Parkinson-s-disease-prediction-with-XGBoost
Accurately detect the presence of Parkinson’s disease in an individual using the Python libraries scikit-learn, numpy, pandas, and xgboost, we will build a model using an XGBClassifier. We’ll load the data, get the features and labels, scale the features, then split the dataset, build an XGBClassifier, and then calculate the accuracy of our model.<br>
The dataset has 24 columns and 195 records.
